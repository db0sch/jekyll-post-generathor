Jekyll Post Genera**thor**
==========================

A small command line script built with [Thor](http://whatisthor.com/).

All the credits goes to [ichadhr](https://github.com/ichadhr) who has done the initial script.
I just changed a couple of lines (to check if the folder exist) and added the date / hour / timezone in the post 'front matter'.
I also got rid of the editor option (which was in the initial script) as I didn't need it.

At some point, I might add option to add categories straight into the command line. We'll see if needed.
